# learning-scikit-learn
Exercises that I have done from examples in "Learning scikit-learn: Machine Learning in Python" by Raul Garreta and Cuillermo Monecchi. They have all of the work in their own github repo here: https://github.com/gmonce/scikit-learn-book

# Conclusion
In chapter 4 of this book, the examples got so bad that I could no longer follow along - I had to quit. I am instead switching to the scikit-learn tutorials...
